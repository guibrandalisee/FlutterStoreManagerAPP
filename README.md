# Store Manager APP

This is a companion app for the **[Flutter Store APP](https://github.com/guibrandalisee/FlutterStoreApp)**

I made this app to learn how to use flutter, so don't expect much

This app was made following an udemy tutorial

**__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________**


For now, the app has the option to add products to the store, manage customer orders and see who your customers are.

There are still some features missing, like the ability to add coupons and physical store locations, and to change the home screen images, but I'm working on that.

# How the app works

The first page is where you can see the names of your customers and how much they have spent on your store

The second page is where you can see all orders from your store

you can also change their current status, for example, if orders are in transit or still in preparation

you can sort orders using the floating action button

On the third screen you can add new products and categories to your store

**For the app to work you have to add your own google-services.json**

Find out how to do it **[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)**

Note that the **[Flutter Store APP](https://github.com/guibrandalisee/FlutterStoreApp)** and this app must be in the same Firebase database

**This app is quite old, so, somethings may not work properly with newer versions of plugins used**
